# text-list-to-array README

My first extension. This extension adds a command which converts comma or newline separated lists to array declarations similar to what is seen in Python and JS/TS. I may add more language support later if and when needed.

## Features

Highlight a block of text to convert it to an array, with each item separated by commas/newlines as its own item.
